Renamed source files and entered preliminary author information (simply all bioboxes members in alphabetical order, plus our PIs). From current activity level, I believe @michaelbarton and @pbelmann are the main contributors, reflected in a proposed joint first authorship.
Take it with a grain of salt please, my main intention was to fill out as much metadata as possible now, not to fix authors nor their order. We (or the core team) should consider all members' activity in the discussion and contribution to the commentary before submitting.
